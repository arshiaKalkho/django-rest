-- pipenv install django, in the dir of the project


--each command follows 'python manage.py' in the directory containing manage.py file
--command 'runserver' does just that
--command 'startproject' makes a primary app
--command 'startapp' creats an app(like component) 
--command 'shell' allows for interaction with django like adding data to db

--after change to one module command 'makemigrations <name of app>' should be used with manage.py, this is like "commit" and applies changes --to staging area of django--. then we can run command 'migrate' which acts like push and makes the actual changes to the project from "the staging area".
